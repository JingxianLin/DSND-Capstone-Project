The dog dataset can be downloaded from here: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip

## Introduction

The main objective of this project will be to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
